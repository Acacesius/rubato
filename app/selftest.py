"""Smoke test run inside the image (CI, and `docker compose exec rubato python -m app.selftest`).

Checks that the pieces YouTube keeps breaking still work, without any cookies:
  1. ytmusicapi search returns songs;
  2. yt-dlp (with Deno + yt-dlp-ejs) can resolve an audio format for PROBE_VIDEO_ID.
Datacenter IPs (e.g. CI runners) often get YouTube's bot check instead of a stream.
That says nothing about the build, so it's reported as "inconclusive" and passes;
any other failure, like a broken signature solver or no formats, fails.
Prints one JSON line; exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail.
